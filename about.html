					<p>Quiet book … soft book … busy book … cloth book … <br>

	They go by many names but the idea is the same. A quiet book (my favorite term) is a series of fabric “pages” containing quiet activities to entertain small children. If you've never seen one before, head over and browse my quiet book page archive (there are more examples at the end of this post as well.)

	Quiet books can be made for any age children. I have seen books for babies with fun, contrasting imagery as well as books for older children containing pieces and game boards for classics like hangman, checkers, and tic tac toe. The typical target age range for quiet books is about two to five, focusing on skills like matching, sorting, imaginative play, and getting dressed (zippers, ties, lacing, etc.)

	Some people design their pages to be sewn together in a permanent book, while others add grommets to their pages and make books with interchangeable pages (like a binder.) I design all my pages to be interchangeable because I feel the book holds my daughter's interest longer when the pages are constantly changing. I also really enjoy designing and including seasonal pages in our quiet book.</p>
